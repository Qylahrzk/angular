## **Setup Instructions**

To clone and run the application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Qylahrzk/angular.git
   cd angular

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   npm install

3. Start the development server:
   ng serve --open

4. If you encounter host or firewall restrictions, use this command:
   ng serve --open --host 0.0.0.0 --disable-host-check

5. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will
   automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
6. Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng
   generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

7. Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/`
   directory.

8. Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

9. Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

10. To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the 
    [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.


## **Project Background**

This project was developed as part of an individual assignment to explore the integration of Angular with Firebase. Following a guided lab activity, the aim was to build a functional web chat application and understand the concepts of real-time database interaction, user authentication, and file storage.


## **Discussion SneekPeak**

**Challenges Faced**
1. Angular Version Compatibility: Resolved by downgrading Angular CLI and core to version 18.

2. Errors During AngularFire Installation: Fixed package.json errors with jsonlint.

3. Firebase Hosting and AI Features: Restricted due to paid plan requirements.

4. Profile Picture Handling: Debugged image URL and adjusted Firebase Storage rules.

5. Local Development Issues: Used alternative commands to bypass host restrictions.

**Lessons Learned**
1. Understanding Angular components, services, and routing.

2. Gaining hands-on experience with Firebase Authentication and Firestore.

3. Debugging errors and leveraging tools like Firebase Emulator Suite.
